I've worked, as a **graphic designer**, with a great teem of passionate fellows from my school of geomatics sciences and surveying engineering, to publish this altogether creative and beautiful magazine.

You'll find some great content that may be of interest to you *(diverse articles, poetry, art, photography ...)* from talented students at [Institut agronomique et vétérinaire Hassan II](https://iav.ac.ma/).

You can read the magazine by visiting the following link: [Cultural Magazine](https://ametop.ma/revue/revue-culturelle/2eme-edition-de-la-revue-culturelle-de-lametop/?fbclid=IwAR2ldU5UF22cviEnUI1huJfw7Sk_rE6_cj3CDy_0bRAQQqUC-od3G7b9olw).
