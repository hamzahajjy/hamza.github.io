This project is an implementation of the **first university campus geoportal** in Morocco.

This project couldn't have seen light without the close cooperation of our fellow professors, in particular [Dr Hajji Hicham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-hajji-hicham-6601606/) and administration officers at Institut agronomique et vétérinaire Hassan II.

The geoportal allows for seamless navigation inside the campus in **2D & 3D** view, giving the user access to the main information about the major structures and buildings.

The app relies on [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for geographic tiles retrieval, and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for site interactivity.

Further development will take place to enhance the geoportal **user experience**.
